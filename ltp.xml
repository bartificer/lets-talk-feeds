            <link>https://lets-talk.ie/ltp133</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This month Bart is joined by Allison Sheridan from the NosillaCast podcast for a wide-ranging conversation revolving around photographing recent astronomical events in modern ways. We start with the observation that the cameras in our phones can now see in the dark better than we can, before moving on to a cool new take on the concept of a telescope that takes the technology powering our phone cameras to a whole other level, before finally circling back to some software tips to help figure out where in the night sky to point our phones to capture the things we can't actually see!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this solo show Bart opines on two very fundament questions — what is art? and what is Photography? The show was inspired by German artist Boris Eldagsen's recent rejection of a prise in the Sony World Photography Awards after he entered an images created with the use of generative AI to see what would happen. Eldagsen has also thrown his support behind a new term for these photo-like creations, 'promptography'.</p>

            <link>https://lets-talk.ie/ltp114</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This month Bart is joined by a very special guest indeed — his beloved husband Wing. Wing just passed an important drone-flying test this week (his 'Specific Category Practical Skills Assessment'). This opens up his third drone-flying certification, allowing him to fly after sunset. Wing's drone-flying passion is tightly linked with a long-term photographic project — capturing images of ancient Irish monuments like ring forts and stone circles. Many of these impressive historical treasures are so large as to be effectively invisible from the ground, so compelling images require a different point of view! Bart invited Wing on to talk about the craft of arial photography with modern prosumer drones, and the hope is to have Wing back on in the future, when his project is more advanced, to talk about the art of arial photography.</p>

            <link>https://lets-talk.ie/ltp113</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In part 1 Bart described AI's evolution from a photographer's point of view — first came classifiers (this is a photo of a dog and a tree), then came smart processing like computational photography on smart phones, auto edit buttons that actually work, and advanced editing tools like content-aware fill, and now, here comes Generative AI, the ability to generate images from scratch using some kind of prompt. Let me tell you what's in the shot, then let me tweak it for you, and now let me create it for you! In this second part, Bart is joined by Antonio Rosario to talk through the pros and cons of each of these kinds of AI for photographers. This then sets up a follow-on conversation on Antonio's Street Shots Podcast where Bart joins Antonio to talk through some of the artists, moral, and ethical implications of all this.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this solo show Bart starts what will be at least a two-part discussion on artificial intelligence, and what it means for photography and photographers. This first part starts with the easy bit — describing what AI is, and what it does with our images today.

            <link>https://lets-talk.ie/ltp111</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this solo show Bart answers friend of the show Allison Sheridan's deceptively simple listener question – 'why 35mm?'. This takes us on a journey from Thomas Edison and the Eastman Kodak company to Leica, Henri Cartier-Bression, Nikon, and eventually DSLRs, Micro Four-Thirds, and full frame sensors. Along the way we demystify some photographic jargon like 'crop factor' and EFL.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this solo show Bart gives his answer to a simple sounding but deceptively complex question from friend of the show Allison Sheridan — how many cameras does the iPhone 14 Pro have? Just two, one on each side? Or maybe four, three on the back and one on the front? But what about that new 2X mode using part of one sensor as what is effectively a different sensor? Is there a single right answer? Or is it Schrödinger's Camera?</p>

Winston Link, Bart digs a little deeper into the whys and the hows of railway photography. The first part of the show explores the differences between thinking about shooting railways as opposed to trains, with the hope of inspiring you to have a go. Following on from that, the second part gives some practical tips that might help you convert your inspiration into great images.</p>

            <link>https://lets-talk.ie/ltp81</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Bart returns for another solo show, picking up where he left off last time. In the previous show Bart gave his take on the so-called ‘Rule of Thirds’ — useful as a guideline sometimes, but definitely not a universal rule! If the rule of thirds is only helpful some of the time, are there other guidelines photographers may fine helpful the rest of the time? Indeed there are, but they don’t have catchy names like the Rule of Thirds, making them harder to remember. Bart tries to remedy this by getting creating and coining (hopefully) humours and hence memorable names for these nuggets of advice.</p>

Rather than focus on a single topic, Bart visits three mini-topics instead. First, a discussion about selfies and social media inspired by an article by Wes Siler entitled ‘Selfies Don’t Kill People’, second, a discussion on minimalistic editing inspired by episode 247 of the Shuttertime Podcast, and finally, a discussion on aspect ratios inspired by episode 13 of the PhotoActive podcast.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the final part of a three-part solo series but Bart. In the first part, <a href="https://lets-talk.ie/ltp41">“How Cameras Work” (Episode 41)</a>, Bart describes the most general definition of a camera - a lens which focuses an image onto a plane which is in some way light-sensitive so it can record that image, and takes a quick tour through history to describe how we got to the modern digital camera. In the second part, <a href="https://lets-talk.ie/ltp42">“Understanding Auto” (Episode 42)</a>, Bart describes just what it is the little computer in a modern digital camera is doing - specifically, what sensors it uses to gather inputs, and what decisions it takes on our behalf. In this final part, Bart describes the spectrum of semi-automatic modes that exist between full auto and full manual, and why you might want to start asserting more control over your camera.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This month Bart is joined by Stefaan Lesage from the Tech45 podcast to talk all about drones. In last month’s show, Antonio Rosario recommended small drones as good presents for photographers, because you could use them as practice before moving on to a big drone. Stefaan Lesage reached out to Bart after listening to that episode with the suggestion of dedicating a future show to the topic of drones (or as Stefaan prefers to call them, UAVs). There are bound to be many drones getting unwrapped over the next few weeks, so now seemed like the perfect time, and Bart and Stefaan got together on Skype and recorded this conversation.</p>

With the giving season freshly behind us, January seemed like the perfect month to start as two-part series on understanding our cameras. All our cameras, regardless of manufacturer, share the same basic groups of features - they all have different modes for metering light, for focusing, and so on. In this first part we focus mostly on exposure and focusing modes.</p>

There are four distinct phases in a photograph’s life, preparation, capture, editing, and publishing. We’ll be dedicating an episode to each of these topics throughout 2014. This month we’re focusing on the first of these phases, the work you can put in before you capture the image to help that image be the best it can.</p>
